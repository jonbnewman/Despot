THIS PROJECT IS ABANDONED - HISTORICAL ARCHIVE ONLY
===========

Despot is a PHP 5.3+ based MVC library/framework. It is meant to be ultra light weight and straight-forward in its use. It's goal is
to encourage a consistent and easy-to-use MVC architecture which enables lightweight, clean implementations...freeing up your time to
do what you need to do...get stuff done.

Currently it is a pet framework I initially developed as a teaching tool for myself, however I have begun to use it on several projects
and am extending it as the use cases require. If you have feedback, please let me know!

NOTE: Documentation is coming, as are unit tests.
